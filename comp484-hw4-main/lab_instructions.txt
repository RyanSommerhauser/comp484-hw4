Creating Lists

In this hw, you will work on the sample Comp484 site to determine where lists are appropriate and then format the list that's best fits the semantic needs of the content.

1.	Examine site navigation
			a.	Applies to: all pages
			b.	Examine the top-level navigation for the site. Currently all links are enclosed in an individual paragraph. Is this semantically sound? 
				Answer: No I dont think that this is semantically sound. Paragraph formats like these are meant for blocks of text, not a list of information
			c. If not, organize the links into the appropriate list type
			
2.	Examine HTML timeline
			a.	Applies to: intro.html
			b.	In the HTML timeline section examine the paragraphs containing relevant dates. Is this the best semantic grouping for this content?
				Answer: No again I think a list makes sense over individual paragraphs for the same reason as problem 1. I think this could have been an ordered or unordered list.
			c. If not, organize the timeline into the appropriate list type

3.	Examine doctype grouping
			a.	Applies to: syntax.html
			b.	Find the section on doctypes
			c. Examine the three doctypes and their examples. Would a list be the best semantic presentation of this content?
				Answer: Again I would say yes becausetThe doctypes are grouped, related items, each with an example, however this one is not as essential as the first 2 problems. 
			d. If so, organize the links into the appropriate list type
			
4.	Examine HTML terms
			a.	Applies to: reference.html
			b.	Find the section for HTML terms
			c. Examine the terms and their descriptions. Is this the best semantic grouping for the content?
				Answer: Once again I would say a list is the best format here. I used a definition list <dl> here because they were an unordered grouping of definitions for terms.
			d. If not, organize the links into the appropriate list type
